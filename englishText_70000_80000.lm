 " Smoke on the Water " be a famous and influential rock song by Deep Purple. It be first release on the album Machine Head .

 Composition .





 The song be know for and recognizable by it central theme , a crunching four-note " blue scale " melody harmonise in parallel fourth that be one of the most famous riff in hard rock history. The riff , play on Fender Stratocaster electric guitar by Ritchie Blackmore , be immediately join by hi-hat and drum and electric bass part before the start of Ian Gillan 's vocal. Jon Lord double the guitar part on a Hammond B3 organ play through a distorted Marshall amp create a very similar tone to the guitar. Blackmore use two finger to pluck so the pair of note can be play exactly simultaneously to match the organ 's timing more closely. Despite the heaviness of the main riff , constant movement and interplay within the supporting part keep the feel of the song from become leaden. The use of the riff only a an interlude between the vocal section ( which feature quite different part ) prevents it from become overly repetitive and create excitement when it re-enters. The song 's powerful structure take a contrasting verse-chorus form , with the drive verse section build musical tension while the soaring chorus release it. To clear up some confusion about how the intro be play , Ritchie Blackmore have be see on videotape playing the intro three different ways. The most common , and perhaps " best " sound , be tabbed below .

 History .

 The lyric of the song tell a true story : on December 4 , 1971 , Deep Purple have set up camp at Montreux , Switzerland to record an album use a mobile recording studio ( rent from the Rolling Stones and know a the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio ) at the entertainment complex that be part of the Montreux Casino ( refer to a " the gambling house " in the song lyric ) . On the eve of the recording session a concert feature Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention be hold in the casino 's theatre ; during the concert a fire broke out ( say to be cause by a Swiss fan shoot a flare gun in the ceiling , a mention in the " some stupid with a flare gun " line ) that eventually destroy the entire casino complex , along with all the Mothers ' equipment. The " smoke on the water " that become the title of the song ( credit to bass player Roger Glover , who relate how the title occur to him when he suddenly wake from a dream a few day later ) refer to the smoke from the fire spread over Lake Geneva from the burning casino a the member of Deep Purple watch the fire from their hotel across the lake. The " Funky Claude " run in and out be refer to Claude Nobs , the director of the Montreux Jazz Festival who help some of the audience to escape the fire .

 Left with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record , the band be force to scout the town for another place to set up. One promise venue ( found by Nobs ) be a local theatre call The Pavilion , but soon after the band have load in and start working/recording , the nearby neighbor take offense at the noise , and the band be only able to lay down back track for one song ( base on Ritchie 's riff and temporarily name Title # 1 ) , before the local police shut them down .

 Finally , after about a week of search , the band rent out the nearly-empty Montreux Grand Hotel and convert it hallway and stairwell into a makeshift record studio , where they lay down most of the track for what would become their most commercially successful album , Machine Head .

 Ironically , the only song from Machine Head not record in the Grand Hotel be Smoke on the Water itself , which have be record during the abort Pavilion session ; only the lyric be compose later , and the vocal be lay down in the Grand Hotel .

 Impact .
 " Smoke on the Water " be include on Machine Head , which be release in early 1972 , but be not release a a single until nearly a year later ( the band have say that they do not expect the song to be a hit ) ; the single would reach # 4 on the Billboard pop single chart in the U.S. in the summer of 1973 , and propel the album to the top 10. Live performance of the tune , feature extended interplay between Blackmore 's guitar and Jon Lord 's Hammond organ would become a centerpiece of Deep Purple 's live show , and a version of the song from the live album Made in Japan become a minor hit on it own later in 1973 .

 The principal song-writers understandably include the song within their subsequent solo endeavour after Deep Purple split up. Ian Gillan in particular perform a jazz-influnced version in early solo concerts. The band Gillan adopt a feedback-soaked approach , courtesy of Gillan guitarist Bernie Torme.The song be also feature live by Ritchie Blackmore 's post-Deep Purple band Rainbow during their tour 1981-83 , and again after Rainbow be resurrect briefly in the mid 1990 's .

 During Ian Gillan 's stint with Black Sabbath in 1983 , they perform " Smoke on the Water " a a regular repertoire number on encore during their only tour together .

 The song be commonly the first song learn by many beginner guitarist , however Blackmore himself have demonstrate that most who attempt to play it do so improperly. This power chord-driven variation on the main recognisable riff be not difficult and consequently be constantly play by learners. In fact , the song be so popular , that one famous guitar store in Denmark Street , London , use to sport a sign on the wall reading " If auditioning a guitar , please refrain from playing 'Smoke on the Water, ' a this be cause our staff mental torture. " In the book The Log by Craig Charles , one of the item in the list of thing never to do before reach the age of thirty be learn the riff from 'Smoke on the Water' .

 It should be note that form of the accusative starting with - only appear in compound words. For example :
 Zanj mi je dal denar. ( He ( person 1 ) give me the money for him ( person 2 ) . ) ( if the 'he ' be refer to the same person , the reflexive personal pronoun would be use ( Zase mi je dal denar. ( He give me the money for himself. ) ) ;
 Za njega mi je dal denar. ( same , except that person 2 be emphasise ) ;
 Sledili smo jim. ( We follow them. ) ;
 Jaz mislim druga e. ( I think otherwise. ) ;
 Spodbudili smo jih , da naj se poka ¸ ejo vredne na ¨ ega zaupanja , a so nas nesramno zavrnili. ( We encourage them to prove themselves worthy of our trust , but they reject u rudely. ) ;
 Nanjo se je zgrnila ena nesre a za drugo. ( She be struck by one misfortune after another. ) ;
 Da bi le njim to lahko dopovedali ! ( If only we could make them understand this ! ) ( the dative pronoun be stress , though the translation use the accusative ) ;
 Zame ni ve re ¨ itve : pugubljena sem. ( For me there be no solution any more : I ( feminine ) am doomed. ) ;
 Pogledal ga je s kancem ironije v o eh. ( He ( person 1 ) look at him ( person 2 ) with a drop of irony in the eyes. ) ;
 Pogledal je njega. ( He ( person 1 ) look at him ( person 2 ) . ) ( the stress be on person 2 ) ;

 Note : The nominative form of personal pronoun be not use in neutral sentence , but rather only when stress the subject , especially so for the first person singular ( I ( Jaz ) ) . While regular form , they be so seldom use , peculiarly in spoken language , that their use strike one a odd. This be likely because , unlike in English , the form of the verb give all applicable information such a the gender , grammatical number and person by itself .

 Reflexive Personal Pronoun ( Povratni osebni zaimek ) .
 The reflexive pronoun in Slovenian be se or sebe. The reflexive personal pronoun be special in that it do not have the nominative form. It be , however , the same for all person and grammatical number ; that it , it be dependent solely on case .

 For example :
 Dative : umivam si roke ( I be wash my hands. ( in German , Ich wasche mir die H ä nde ) ) ;
 Accusative : umivam se ( I be wash myself. ( in German , Ich wasche mich. ) ) ;
 Dative : umivate si roke ( You be wash your hands. ( in German , Sie waschen sich die H ä nde ) ) ;
 Accusative : umivate se ( You be wash yourselves. ( in German , Sie waschen sich. ) ) ;

 Similarly a in German and English , the reflexive pronoun can sometimes be replace by the reciprocal phrase drug drugega ( each other , one another ; in German , einander ) . Thus : " Drug drugemu umivata roke. " ( The two of them be wash each other 's hand ; or in German , Sie waschen einander die H ä nde ) or " Umivata drug drugega. " ( The two of them be wash each other , or in German , Sie waschen einander ) .

 The accusative se can bind with prepositional word just like other personal pronoun ; it be , namely , an enclitic :
 Nase je nanesla lepotilno kremo. ( She put beautify cream on herself. ) ;
 Ampak ko dela zase , dela u inkovito. ( But when he/she work for him-/herself , he/she work efficiently. ) ;

 Other case and example :
 Sebi gradi grobnico. ( He/She be build a tomb for him-/herself. ) ;
 Gradi si grobnico. ( the same , but the emphasis be not so much on for whom the tomb be , but rather the tomb or the building itself ) ;
 S sabo/seboj ni zadovoljna. ( She be not happy with herself. ) ( instrumental case ) ;
 Najprej po isti pri sebi , potlej ¨ ele kritiziraj druge ! ( First clean up at yourself , only then criticise others ! ) ( locative case ) ;
 Ko je videl odsev sebe v ogledalu , mu je ta pogled povsem pokvaril dan. ( When he saw the reflexion of himself in the mirror , this sight completely ruin the day for him. ) ( genitive case , but a clumsy and not widely used construction at that , since genitive possession be much better express with an adjectival possessive pronoun : 'Ko je videl svoj odsev v ogledalu ... ' ) ;

 The substantival interrogative pronoun introduce direct and indirect questions. There be two nominative form : kdo ( who ) and kaj ( what ) . They be decline a shown at case above .

 Komu naj dam to ? ( To whom ought I to give this ? ) ;
 esa ne smem storiti ? ( What may n't I do ? ) ;

 kdor | kar ;
 kogar | esar ;
 komur | emur ;
 kogar | kar ;

 Kdor krade , ni po ¨ ten. ( Someone who steal be not honest. ) ;
 Kar pove ¨ , tega ne more ¨ ve obvladovati. ( Something that you say , that you can not control any more. ) ;
 Odrekli so ji mo ¸ nost do izbire odvetnika , s imer je bila kr ¨ ena njena ustavna pravica. ( They refuse her the option of choosing a solicitor , with which her constitutional right be violated. ) ;

 Negative Pronoun ( Nikalni zaimek ) .
 The negative pronoun , a substantival pronoun at that , start with ni- : nih e ( nobody ) , ni ( nothing ) ( similar be also the adverb nikjer ( nowhere ) , nikoli ( never ) , nikdar ( never ) , however they be not true pronoun , since they be not inflect ) .

 < doc id = " 3859512 " title = " Model Penal Code " nonfiltered = " 69 " process = " 67 " dbindex = " 70070 " >
 The Model Penal Code ( MPC ) be a statutory text which be develop by the American Law Institute ( ALI ) in 1962. The current form of the MPC be last update in 1981. The purpose of the MPC be to stimulate and assist legislature in make an effort to update and standardize the penal law of the United States of America. The standard they use to make a determination of what the penal code should be be one of " contemporary reasoned judgment " mean what a reason person at the time of the development of the MPC would judge the penal law to do. The ALI perform an examination of the penal system in the USA and the prohibition , sanction , excuse , and authority that be use throughout. The MPC be a combination of what the ALI deem to be the best rule for the penal system in the United States. Since it formulation , the MPC have play an important role in standardizing the codified penal law of the United States .

 Key Features .
 A key feature of the MPC be it use of standardized men rea ( criminal mind ) term to determine level of mental state , just a murder be consider more severe if done intentionally rather than accidentally. These term be ( in descending order ) " purposefully , " " knowingly , " " recklessly , " and " negligently , " with a fifth state of " absolute liability. " If an offense require a specific mental state , than any more criminal mental state will do. Thus if an offense be define in the form , " It be illegal to knowingly do X , " then it be illegal to do X knowingly or purposely , but not to do so recklessly or negligently. Absolute liability mean that it be illegal to do something , regardless of one 's mental state. The use of standard term allow law to be relatively simply word and comprehensible. The two highest form of culpability , purposely and knowingly , be frequently group together a " intentional " , where a recklessness and negligence be consider " unintentional " . If a law make an actor absolutely liable for an offense , the actor can only be guilty of what the MPC call violation , which only deserve penalty of fine , and no jail time. See section 2.05 and 1.04 .

 Another important feature be that under the MPC , any action not explicitly outlaw be legal. This concept follow the say , " That which be not forbid be allow " a oppose to " That which be not allow be forbidden. " Legal scholar contrast the MPC 's limit with law pass by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia , which allow people to be punish for act not specifically outlaw but similar to act that be .

 Under the MPC , ignorance of criminal law be not consider a valid defense , unless the legislature intend on make the mistake of law a defense , the law be unknown to the actor and have not be publish , or the actor be act a a result of some official statement about the law. See section 2.02 ( 9 ) and 2.04 .

 Certain part of the MPC contain multiple option , invite state to choose one. A particularly controversial topic be the proper place of the death penalty in the MPC. However , the MPC explicitly state that the " Law Institute take no position on the desirability of the death penalty. " Note that no state be obligate to adopt any specific part of the MPC ; see below .

 Criticism .
 Advocates of the MPC stress that the law must be clearly define to prevent arbitrary enforcement , or a chilling effect on a population that do not know what action be punishable. However , critic say that the assumption that there be no possible legal system between the extreme of " forbidden " and " allow " be the central weakness of the MPC. British law , for example , assume that a jury can decide what be " reasonable " both in the context of British law and social expectation a well a the specific accusation they be be ask to judge. Behaviour may thus be deem unlawful by a jury in case where the MPC would require legislative change to produce a conviction .

 Use .
 The MPC be not law in any jurisdiction of the United States ; however , at least 37 state have adopt revise version of the MPC. Though many state only adopt portion of the MPC , state such a New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , and Oregon have enact almost all of the provision .

 On rare occasion the court will turn to the MPC for it commentary on the law and use it to seek guidance in interpreting non-code criminal statutes. It be also use frequently a a tool for comparison .

 From a early a 1990 , Richard D. James have be in demand a a remix artist , much to his report dismay.

 Upon be ask to do a remix for U.S. pop singer Madonna , James reply that he would produce the track on the sole condition that she portray a pig on it for him. In addition , accord to an interview with Mixmaster Morris during the Breezeblock " We Luv Aphex " tribute show on October 31 , 2005 , when an unnamed female pop artist request a remix a few year ago , she be flatly ignore by Richard. She then supposedly fly to London , track down Richard at a club , and be tell that he 'd only do the track if she " record a quota of noise with her genitilia " onto a DAT tape for sampling. Whether this be another variation of the Madonna story or just a flat out lie be unclear .

 Another popular story claim that a man show up at Richard 's home one morning , claim to be the representative for the band The Lemonheads , to whom James owe a remix. Having completely forget about this agreement , James quickly go to his home studio , Lannerlog , and copy off an original piece completely unrelated to the original mix , which he hand over for several thousand dollars. Despite receive payment for the track , it be never include on any album. This tale be not so unbelievable give that James be infamous for remixing track to the point that they become new musical work with little left intact from the original composition .

James allegedly claim to have never hear ( and not want to hear ) the original NIN album , so it appear he contribute two original piece instead of remixes ( duly tag " Created by Aphex Twin " ) . However , the end of " The Beauty of Being Numb " do incorporate the compress sound of the track " Eraser " from the original NIN album in the background , this be leave over from further down the spiral , when it fade into the coil remix of Eraser. James later express a desire to tour with Nine Inch Nails and incorporate sample from the NIN track " Heresy " into a live set with Chris Cunningham .

 The track " At the Heart of It All " may have be influence by the 1984 Coil track of the same name : Coil 's track be very different , a beatles and dark post-classical piece of piano and clarinet , but it melody and ambiance can be hear in the slow underlying melody that resonate a horn in the background of Aphex Twin 's piece. Both Coil and Aphex Twin work on the NIN remix album to which James contribute this track. Rumors say they have work together on the song " The Snow ( Answers Come in Dreams ) " but it be indeed make by Coil and Jack Dangers ( of Meat Beat Manifesto fame ) .

 Jules White ( born Jules Weiss on 17 September 1900 in Budapest , Hungary , die 30 April 1985 in Van Nuys , California ) be a movie director and producer of the silent film era .

In 1933 White be appoint head of Columbia Pictures ' short film division , which become the most prolific comedy factory in Hollywood. Between 1934 and 1957 Jules White produce and/or direct 136 Three Stooges short .

 White 's approach to directing be root in silent comedy , so he make his sound film the same way. He pace the visual action very fast , and coach his actor to gesture broadly and react violently. This emphasis on cartoonish slapstick work well in the right context , but could become blunt and shock when stretched too far. White be generally under pressure to finish his production within a few day , so very often producer White have no inclination to tone down director White , and the outlandishly violent gag stay in. ( Jules White 's personal favorite gag , which he use again and again , be probably the one where an actor be stuck in the posterior by a sharp object , and then yell , " Help , help ! I 'm lose my mind ! " ) Still , moviegoer love these slam-bang short comedy , and Columbia produce more than 500 of them over a quarter of a century .

 Almost 40 percent of White 's output star The Three Stooges ; the other film feature such screen favorites a Buster Keaton , Andy Clyde , Harry Langdon , Hugh Herbert , Vera Vague , and El Brendel. To date , only the Stooges and Keaton material have be release to home video .

 White be profile in two book , " The White Brothers " ( also know a " Behind the Three Stooges : The White Brothers " ) by David Bruskin , ISBN 1882766008 , and " The Columbia Comedy Shorts " by Ted Okuda with Edward Watz , ISBN 0786405775 .

 Gap penalty be use during sequence alignment. Gap penalty contribute to the overall score of alignment , and therefore , the size of the gap penalty relative to the entry in the similarity matrix affect the alignment that be finally selected. Selecting a higher gap penalty will cause le favourable character to be align , to avoid creating a many gap .

 Linear gap penalty .
 Linear gap penalty be the simplest type of gap penalty. The only parameter , d , be a penalty per gap. This be almost always negative , so that the alignment with le gap be favour over the alignment with more gaps. Under a linear gap penalty , the overall penalty for one large gap be the same a for many small gap .

 Affine gap penalty .
 Affine gap penalty attempt to overcome this problem. In biological sequence , for example , it be much more likely that one big gap of length 10 occurs in one sequence , due to a single insertion or deletion event , than it be that 10 small gap of length 1 be made. Therefore , affine gap penalty have a gap open penalty , c , and a gap extension penalty , e. A gap of length l be then give a penalty c + ( l-1 ) e. So that gap be discourage , c and e be almost always negative. Furthermore , because a few large gap be better than many small gap , e be almost always smaller than c .

 The Fountain of Life , or in it earlier form the Fountain of Living Waters , be a Christian iconography symbol associate with baptism , first appearing in the 5th century in illuminated manuscript and later in other art form such a panel painting .

 The symbol be usually show a a fountain enclose in a hexagonal structure cap by a rounded dome and support by eight columns. The fountain of living water , fons vivus be a baptismal font ( a water fountain in which one be baptize , and thus reborn with Christ ) , and be often surround by animal associate with Baptism such a the hart. The font probably represent the octagonal Lateran Baptistery in Rome , consecrate by Pope Sixtus III ( 432-440 ) , which be iconographically associate with the fountain of the water of life mention in Revelation 21.6 .

 The best example date from the Carolingian period : the Godescalc Evangelistary make to commemorate the Baptism of the son of Charlemagne in 781 , and in the Soissons Gospels .

 In the Ghent Altarpiece : The Adoration of the Lamb by Jan Van Eyck ( 1438 ) , the Lamb of God stand upon an altar dress a for the Mass of the Precious Blood , with a blood-red frontal : the Lamb 's blood be catch in a chalice , and it Eucharistic intention be signal by the dove of the Holy Spirit above. In the foreground , offering the other mean of grace , be the Fountain of the Living Water surround by the faithful. In the Prado , Madrid , be the Fountain of Living Water emanating from the Lamb of God , in which the open fountain be set into the outer wall of Heaven. That the water be not merely the purifying water of baptism be show by the innumerable wafer that float upon it surface : the two sacrament be represent a one .

 In a miniature in a Book of Hours , probably paint at Ghent at the end of the fifteenth century , the Fountain of Living Water have give way to a fountain of blood , the Fountain of Life. in which the figure of Christ stand upon a Gothic pedestal at the center and fill the fountain from his wound , though the aureole that surround him identify him a the transfigure Christ and the location a Paradise .

 In Flanders at the close of the Middle Ages an intense devotion to the Precious Blood of Christ give rise to an iconographic tradition of the fifteenth and sixteenth century , which render the theological concept of Grace , express Roman Catholic dogma allegorically a a fountain of blood. This transformation be first address in Evelyn Underhill in 1910 , take her point of departure an Assembly of Saints and the Fountain of Life of 1596 in Ghent , in which blood from the five Holy Wounds of Christ into the upper basin of a " Fountain of Life " and stream out through opening in the lower " Fountain of Mercy " . Saints and martyr , patriarch and prophet hold golden chalice of blood , which some empty into the fountain. Below the faithful hold out their heart to receive droplet of blood .

 Anagenesis , also know a " phyletic change " , be the progressive evolution of specie involve a change in gene frequency in an entire population rather than a cladogenetic branching event. When enough mutations reach fixation in a population to significantly differentiate from an ancestral population a new specie name may be assigned. A key point be that the entire population be different from the ancestral population so that the ancestral population can be consider extinct. It be easy to see from the preceding definition how controversy can arise among taxonomist regard when the difference be significant enough to warrant a new specie classification. Anagenesis may also be refer to a phyletic evolution .

It be a component of the World Climate Programme. The objective of the programme be to develop the fundamental scientific understanding of the physical climate system and climate process need to determine to what extent climate can be predict and the extent of human influence on climate. The programme encompass study of the global atmosphere , ocean , sea ice , land ice ( such a glacier , ice cap and ice sheet ) , and the land surface which together constitute the Earth 's physical climate system .

 WCRP activity address issue of scientific uncertainty in the Earth 's climate system include transport and storage of heat by the ocean , the global energy and hydrological cycle , the formation of cloud and their effect on radiative transfer , and the role of the cryosphere in climate. These activity match the scientific priority identify by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , and provide the basis for respond to issue raise in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. WCRP also lay the scientific foundation for meeting the research challenge pose in Agenda 21. Together with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and the International Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme , WCRP provide the international framework for scientific cooperation in the study of global climate change .

 Scientific guidance for the programme be provide by a Joint Scientific Committee consist of 18 scientist select by mutual agreement between the three sponsor organization .

 KEGL , brand a " La Preciosa 97.1 " , be a radio station transmit on 97.1 FM , serve the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. It be own and operate by Clear Channel Communications .

 About KEGL .
 KEGL be a 100,000 watt radio station broadcast from Cedar Hill , TX , cover the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex market. It be license to Fort Worth , TX .

 Formerly KWXI then KFJZ of Ft. Worth ( Z97 ) , KEGL be a legendary rock and roll station in the Metroplex. In 1981 , Randy Brown or " Christopher Haze " , his airname , become the P.D. of 97.1 and change the call letter and image of the station. The Eagle 97 KEGL be born. Within a short period of time , the station become pretty successful with their hybrid rock and top 40 format know a Rock/40. ( KEGL be one of the most successful Rock/40 station ever ) Stevens and Prewitt be the morning show of that time period. Later , Robbins , Kinney & Cowan replace Stevens and Prewitt. A guy from Houston , Moby , be add to the lineup a the afternoon drive jock .

 Kidd Kraddick ( now at Kiss 106.1 ) start at night , then move to afternoon drive when Moby in the Morning replace RKC that jump ship to do wakeups in Sacramento. ( They do n't last long there ! ) Another well-known Metorplex jock that work at The Eagle in the 80 be Russ Martin ( now on live 105 ) . Moby in the Morning , a highly rat show , be remove from KEGL because of FCC allege violation of content. Kraddick be move to mornings. Though most of the 80 , the station be own by Sandusky , a newspaper company. The studio be locate in the Xerox tower in Los Colinas , a suburb of Dallas .

 The very late 1980s and early 1990s be n't good to the Eagle. At first they go more down the dance/top 40 road under the direction of Joel Folger , later in 1992 go more rock-based. Eventually KEGL go to a harder rock sound. Though the 90 , this be what KEGL be know for. KEGL be a Howard Stern affiliate for several year in the 90 , until he verbally attack the new ownership , Nationwide , an insurance company. Another controversial show that air on KEGL in the 90 be Kramer and Twitch at night. A prank be air state that Britney Spears be dead in an accident , to the horror of her fans. Trouble follow , and Kramer and Twitch be jettison from The Eagle. Under Nationwide , KEGL 's rating be stagneted. Later under Clear Channel , the rating and revenue fell .

 A decision be make to eliminate the rock format on KEGL a CC also own The Edge. The Eagle be flip off in 2004 to make way for " Sunny 97.1 " , a 1960s to 1980s-based A/C format by playing " When Eagles Fly " by Sammy Hagar. The first song for " Sunny " be " Here Comes the Sun " by The Beatles. Poorly produce and compete head-on with KVIL and share audience with KLUV , " Sunny " last about a year. From 1992-1996 , the " Sunny " branding be once use on KSNN-FM ( now KWRD ) a a Classic country station. In 2005 , KEGL be flush down the toilet to become La Preciosa , a Spanish music station...not to be confuse with KDFT-AM 's La Poderosa station. Competing against several lower-powered rim-shot signal for the Spanish marketshare , KEGL 's 100,000 watt signal quickly soar to the top of DFW 's ratings. Currently in March of 2005 , they be a strong # 2 and be # 1 with illegal alien .

 A Cycloaddition be a pericyclic chemical reaction , in which two bond be lose and two bond be gain the result reaction be a cyclization reaction .

 Cycloadditions be usually describe by the backbone size of the participants. This would make the Diels-Alder a + 2cycloaddition , and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition a + 2cycloaddition. This type of reaction be non-polar addition reaction .

 Reaction mechanism .
 Thermal cycloadditions usually have 4n + 2 electron participate in the starting material. These occur , for reason of orbital symmetry , in a suprafacial-suprafacial or antarafacial-antarfacial manner ( rare ) . There be a few example of thermal cycloadditions which have 4n electron ; ( for example the + 2 cycloaddition ) , these proceed in a suprafacial-antarafacial sense , such a the dimerisation of ketene , in which the orthogonal set of p orbitals allow the reaction to proceed via a cross transition state .

 Cycloadditions in which 4n electron participate can also occur a a result of photochemical activation. Here , one component have an electron promote from the HOMO ( bonding ) to the LUMO ( * antibonding ) . Orbital symmetry be then such that the reaction can proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. One example be the photochemical dimerization of cinnamic acid :

 ;

 Note that not all photochemical ( 2 + 2 ) cyclizations be cycloadditions ; some be know to operate by radical mechanism .

 Some cycloadditions instead of bond operate through strain cyclopropane ring ; a these have significant character. For example , an analog for the diels-alder reaction be the quadricyclane-DMAD reaction :



 In the ( i + j + ... ) cycloaddition notation i and j refer to the number of atom involve in the cycloaddition. In this notation a Diels-Alder reaction be a ( 4 + 2 ) cycloaddition and a 1,3-dipolar addition such a the first step in ozonolysis be a ( 3 + 2 ) cycloaddition. The IUPAC prefer notation however , with take electron into account and not atoms. In this notation the DA reaction and the dipolar reaction both become a cycloaddition. The reaction between norbornadiene and an activated alkyne be a cycloaddition .

 Types of cycloaddition .

 Two major cycloaddition reaction be :

 Diels-Alder reaction ;
 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition ;

 Formal cycloadditions .
